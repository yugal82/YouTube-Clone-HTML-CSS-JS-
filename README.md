# YouTube-Clone-HTML-CSS-JS-

I've tried to clone YouTube purely using HTML, CSS and Javascript.
The final clone is not as good as original but it is a multi-page clone and plays a song after clicking on the thumbnail.
After clicking it re-directs to a new page where the .mp4 file is played in the background.
